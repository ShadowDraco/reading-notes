# Learning Git Branching

1. The exercise went very well, I enjoyed immersing myself
   into understanding the basic ideas of git visually.
   I hadn't learned anything about rebasing, and most of my attempts to merge
   were very confusing in the VS Code merge editor giving me duplicated code.
   Seeing these visualizations and understanding why I should create branches and
   exactly how often has been enlightening.

2. I want to know more about the HEAD and how to control it, as well as how to undo commits
   I still feel like making branches regularly may be an inconvenience but working with a group
   will give significance to branches

3. It took me about 20 minutes while I re did a couple of the assignments and reread them
   I was expecting a long 40 minute assignment but it was quick even while I was a little distracted.
