# Diversity and Inclusion speaker

Share one or two ways the speakerâ€™s information will change your approach to your career transition.

- It was very interesting information and it its enlightening to know that big companies are looking for people who are customer obsessed. They need diversity in thought and innovation more than they need inclusively. It just seems like inclusively is a chore and a problem people don't want to solve. But despite that requirement for businesses what they really want is people who can figure out what customers _want_

List a few key take-aways from this presentation.

- There are more men called John leading a company than women leading a company. Very interesting
- Diversity and inclusion builds off of _Psychological safety and Implicit Bias awareness_
- diversity is not a pipeline problem for the tech industry (lack of diverse candidates)
- Who was in the room when product (x) was designed can make a big difference
- Tech companies are looking for employees who are **customer-obsessed**
