What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm. It's a way of writing code that avoids messy class structures and manual state changing

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- pure functions return the same result and do not cause noticeable side effects such as giving the wrong value based on parameters given.

What are the benefits of a pure function?

- Pure functions will not modify other parts of the code which creates easier testing, better readability and gives code a consistent way of handling local/private data

What is immutability?

- unchanging or unable to be changed

What is Referential transparency?

- If a function _always_ yields the same output from the same input it is Referentially Transparent

What is a module?

- require includes the module elsewhere (like importing it)

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- export

What do we have to do to make a module available?
