## CRUD is the _way_ to interact with servers and API's its important to understand everything we are doing

[CRUD Basics](https://medium.com/geekculture/crud-operations-explained-2a44096e9c88)

- put and delete

[Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNcBhSv1Wo)

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

-

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

- Create an express app
- install a something to talk to the database like mongoose or monk
- add a route for the api
- create Schemas and models for each "topic"
- let the api route handle CRUD for its own topics
- for each "topic" add create read update delete (api/faqs/CRUD)

## things I want to know more about

- Validation and alternatives to mongoose. Monk is a library for interacting with MongoDB like monk but what is a term for that? In the video he says "its a library to CRUD mongoose" haha but is there a term for what it does?
