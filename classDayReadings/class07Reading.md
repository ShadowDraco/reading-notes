# REST - and what it is

## knowing about rest and how API's work will enable use to implement a backend into our applications

### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

- The guy who is known for helping write the first web servers, that send documents across the internet and then did research explaining how it all works

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

- The technology and code and machines that were built are all designed and maintained by different people and companies. They are not built to communicate with each other, only themselves.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

- The http protocol is capable of descriing the location of something (or information) from around the world (to anywhere in the world)

**What does a GET do?**

- get Fetches a resouce

**What does a POST do?**

- Post gives a resource to someone else

**What does PUT do?**

- replaces another resource

**What does PATCH do?**

- does a partial update to a resource

## API Keys

### npm run get api-keys --all

- looks like we got them all

## Things I want to know more about

- patch and put, never used them but I feel like it would be better to learn how to use those than to POST when
  giving a small update to a user's data like a profile description change perhaps? It could also just depend on how it's implemented?
