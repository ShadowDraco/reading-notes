- Personal computers became available for the average person. Marketed almost entirely to boys and men.

Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

When are diversity efforts most successful?

- They are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders who understand why diversity matters

Why do diverse companies perform better?

- diverse companies perform better because the people running the top and bottom rungs have more input and experience from varying sources and processes. If everyone in the company is too similar it creates a customer base that also needs to be similar, therefore marginalizing the target audience.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

- A diverse user base can require a company to create resources with high levels of accessibility while including information and experience from various sources. A diverse company can supply information or technology that meets the needs of a varying user base more effectively and efficiently
