# Training is about mindset _and_ practice

## Things I want to know more about

- What do these people have to say that will give me new perspective?
- What will they say that refreshes my current mindset?

### [Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)

- Learning new and growing does not come by running the same drills over and over, but by taking on new challenge. If I go build fullstack application without applying any new features or researching new flows during my down time it may be beneficial to practice things I haven't done for awhile but it would be much more meaningful to try something new and even to fail at implementing it. Making steps towards and researching new ideas is very good for learning.

### [The power of believing you can improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

- People can learn in a much more positive way when they have a mindset that is not fixed to believing that they are failing or falling behind.
- Learning is great when people do not run from difficulty and believe that they can improve or figure things out!
- "Not yet" is a thought process for people to think that they can learn something and not have a shallow understanding of effort and perseverance, engagement, and just taking the time to be confident and try.
- Confidence is the willingness to try, and this makes a big difference, growth mindset isn't always the words or ideas you are thinking actively, but whether or not you decide to try.
- Seeing Effort and difficulty as a good and empowering thing that causes growth and rather than a reason to leave or quit is the biggest reason for learning

### [Grit: passion and perseverance](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/c)

- In education the one thing that is measured best is IQ, but understanding why successful students _are_ successful is most effective in improving outcomes for learning.
- Grit (the passion nad perseverance for long term goals) students who live and learn and work with **grit** are the most successful and most likely to succeed. They don't give up and they _want_ to keep going and they have goals.
- Grit has nothing to do with talent, growth mindset is good for building grit, and having a growth mindset helps people to push on and reach those goals.

### [Redefining success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

- It's hard for people to be comfortable because we have ideas that are conflicting with reality. We are made to believe everyone can do anything. We are all left with Envy, low self-esteem, and dreams that are extremely difficult to attain without a great and realistic plan. People who are at the top are decided that they should be there, and everyone in the bottom is also judged as deserving to be there.
- People take what happens to them extremely personally, success and failure
- Meritocracy is the idea that everyone will get to where they are supposed to get to good or bad.
- We are a society that is very much worshipping ourselves, we are stuck on our own values, accomplishments, etc. It affects our views of success and the world
- Our ideas about success are generally not our own, we shape our thoughts and goals, what we want, and how we view ourselves based on all of these suggestions from the world. To fix all of these problems within ourselves and society, **ideas of success should be truly our own**
