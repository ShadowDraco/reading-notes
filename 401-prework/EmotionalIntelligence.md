Lately I've gone through a lot of things that have forced me to check myself and stay silent in situations that target my character. I've been put in the position of keeping my composure and reputation while controlling a situation many times and I've grown from it a lot. I've studied the way I affect others and the way they affect me in great detail. Recently I feel that I've grown a lot and relying on God has been the reason. I know I have an example to live by and I intend to follow Him while I work and learn, so I'm quite pleased to confidently answer questions about emotional intelligence with high-marks. I just have to continue to back it up now and grow in other areas to support it!
