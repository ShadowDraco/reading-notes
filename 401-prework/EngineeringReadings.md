# Mindset and Motivation

  - Using your time wisely is what most of the success will come down to in the long run. My schedule should not be based on leisure time activities. A schedule for success would be to put in effort to research and development of my profession each day.

  - Programmers will run into many complex logic problems, and incorporate the problems from other programs and programmers into their own work. That's called a framework (haha) The need for an efficient way to break down these problems and solve them is very high. Considering and following some steps when learning and following some steps while putting this knowledge into practice is imperative. This is why there are programming best practices and why programmers break everything into smaller components.

- We need to solve problems efficiently. In business and in development we will need to ask questions and determine the best course of action before moving forward. For simple tasks like making a to-do list finding the root components to build the app and creating a map is just as important compared to solving a complex issue in data structures and algorithms. Before you start you should learn the issue, examine the whys, and the hows. Then begin to create a solution.  

- [The super mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)\

  - learning is a process. We have fun learning when we don't beat ourselves up, and seeing progress without negative feedback is the most optimal way to improve. We should enjoy playing the game of progress as we learn and gain experience. As new frameworks are developed we can explore them and rejoice in the magical ways they solve problems for us. Learning useQuery in react was a horrible experience, I barely knew how hooks worked or how to make one for way too long in my learning process and always resorted to useEffect and axios. But each time I went and attempted useQuery and watched tutorials and read docs etc etc. I came back to this idea with more knowledge each time. Like going back to previous levels and clearing them without losing a life (finding myself on stack overflow 50 times) and then going and trying it again. Recently I came back to try useQuery and created a bunch of custom hooks, successfully used multiple queries to a database and API and kept the code clean and modular. I got stuck on useMutation and could not find a way to implement it but I found progress and not set back in this endeavor. I feel like this lesson was my super mario for awhile.

## Things I want to know more about

- UseMutation... 
- tress, graphs, lists, tests, measuring function scalability with Big O
