# Bias self assessment

- Empathy and curiosity is one of my stronger areas, I always try to relate, understand, and learn about what's going on and how its affecting everyone around me. 
- My weakest areas are bias and Identity, and what is bias. To me bias in the work place is a lot more simple, and in some ways all of this to me *is* a little too political. But that's probably because I hate bias and the idea of bias and wish it didn't exist and we would all love each other as we love ourselves and live happy lives. See simple! haha 
- I want to focus most on interacting with people in the work place and understanding what it means and what its like to work with everyone.
