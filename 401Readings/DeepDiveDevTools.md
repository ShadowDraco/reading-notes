## [Deep Dive: Dev Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGNQCisfj8Q)

- Working across many languages nd frameworks is tough. Though there are some things that are always the same. Code is code. Dev tools are dev tools. VSCode handles things the same way pretty consistently, Chrome handles things pretty consistently, even PyCharm and IntelliJ Idea and Java Eclipse, and Visual Studio and Repl all handle things quite consistently. Knowing how to use your dev tools to read and use errors is **VITAL**
