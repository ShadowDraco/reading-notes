- Know yourself, and know your situation.
  - Your pitch should be well versed, but make it fit the moment and the people. Your conversation is not all about you its about where you are at too.
  - Know your deliverables and figure out how to bring it in properly.
  - People who go above and beyond to make things more efficient and make sure that's well known, these experiences and competencies make a big difference. It shows what you are capable of and the problems you can solve goes further than the experience you bring on board.
- Use a period at the end of your sentences.
- Tell a story, be a hero. Use the resources in your story to _then_ build on your skills and potential.
  I'm was a dancer for many years, teaching and performing \*That gave me a strong sense of teamwork and perseverance. It required my dedication to perfection and growth.... USE it to further the point. Even if you can't include every skill you ever gained make it connect, make it good. This is a pitch and not the whole game.
