# Routine for when class is over

## [Routine](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mh3X_w274zi2lYHme0HBnLTyL6rOP88UX9-5exa9zZo/edit)

- Starting directly after the class is over I am starting a sort of freelance development project and already have a client lined up. I will most likely spend most of my day working on this project and collaborating with the people involved in the company as this company is a place that I have targeted.
- After working on that main project I will spend time working the website and youth group I am leading at church
- When I am done with this project (if it goes well) I am expecting to have a job or at least many valuable connections with big places who I really want to work with. I will follow the schedule that is provided to make sure I spend the right time of working on code, searching for opportunities, making schedules, remembering names, and planning events.
