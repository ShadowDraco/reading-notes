# Stacks and Queues

Stacks are a data structure consisting of nodes. It's basically a linked list with a specific use case... To order things FILO or LIFO. First in Last Out, or Last in First Out. Unlike a line at the store which is First in FIRST OUT, stacks are the opposite. In terms of linked lists, the HEAD becomes TOP, and the names of functions in reference to a Stack is different, however much of the base functionality is greatly the same! Queues are like a line at the store. First in first out. Or Last in last out. Very similar even when the terminology is mixed up a bit.
