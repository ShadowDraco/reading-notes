Reading these articles I learn that some very important things required by recruiters are communication skills, research, interest, and the ability to show that you are capable of filling a role. You should be able to communicate well with the recruiter, and in terms of the job/business you are looking for. These company recruiters are not hiring an open role in a fast food restaurant, they are hiring for a position in a business role that requires expertise in the field. You have to show you've got what they are looking for within a few minutes of reading your resume/letter, and conversation in person or on the phone.
After you ensure that you are brushed up on your knowledge of the company and how to present yourself it is highly recommended to be familiar with the interview process itself, both for the position you are applying for and to be prepared mentally and practice the interviews yourself. Finally after you are prepared for the interview, be sure to know what your job is worth and what you are worth. Understand the package you are getting/asking and know your ability and worth.
