# Meeting with Alexander Gounares

## Main idea

Presentation series with Alex Gounares, CEO of Polyverse: Using AI to build an AI-powered iPhone app in 4 weeks!
Todayâ€™s topic: Get ready to ship! (Monitoring, security, compliance, etc.)

### Notes

Can you hack someone with a package? Yes if someone send you a package with a device inside with a battery and network capabilities hackers can get access to your network and information through the wifi. You can even get hacked **from your fridge** .... who would have thought.

Cyber attacks are typically mounted through individuals or business that have connections with bigger, greater corporations/governments. Cyber security is tough because technology is a monoculture. We all have windows or macs, we're all using Zoom and we have only a few differences between us.

Every Attacker is driven by or limited by economics. Everyone wants money, needs money. Stealing need to go unnoticed, so there are things that are motivators and things that are walls to climb over

**Shift Left** Cyber security is an important model for building applications that starts on the left with design, coding, initial testing, beta, and finally deployment. The model states that it is cheapest to fix problems on the left of the model and gets more expensive on the right. Its expensive to fix those mistakes when there is a monoculture that has not used multi-factor authentication and perfected the design before the code.

### Greatest Takeaways

Cyber security is a very important, and sensitive topic. It is always changing and will always be required everywhere we go. We cannot just build walls around our places and expect security to come with it unless we go back to paper or find another way of ensuring that people cannot mount attacks on our tech. It was extremely enlightening to learn about just how serious the cyber security world is.
