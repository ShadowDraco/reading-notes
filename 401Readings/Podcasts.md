# Syntax and This Developer's life!

## Syntax: Where should you deploy??

- Serverless means - we don't have a server running a bunch of processing power at all times. The server will spin up instances of a page or connection as it is needed. Unlike a database instance where the database itself is running in one place, serverless instances are n amount of connections to the server which access the database.
- Server-full instances are servers that are running and can take multiple connections, but are simply being hosted constantly.
- Edge servers are a distibution of servers close to the users location. Its somewhere between Server-full and server-less
- CDN is a way of distributing server instances from a main location
- CI/CD is the continuous integration and deployment that makes development more convienent and seemless
- Cron jobs allow the server to run certain functions after a set period
- Pricing is done by "Wall buy" - based on the amount of clock time that you are running functions and waiting for responses etc. "Cpu time" - the literal amount of time that the server is doing work. Lastly paying a flat price for a set level of data and power etc

- Comparisons. AWS, Azure, and Google are the biggest out of the big 10, then there are 7 more _main_ deployment places
- flight control .dev - a service that helps with deploying to AWS integrating with your own account
- Render - a server-full deployment service that is great for node services and hosting databases quickly and easily
- Vercel - A highly popular provider that pays for usage and seats with excellent analytics and SPEED, its soooo fast to do everythingggg! good pricing and a really great user experience for developers
- Heroku - uses build packs to deploy various types of services built with many options and languages quickly and easily. Has changed negatively over time though after they were bought out. - That's probably why Its always a pain to use...
- digital ocean is pretty good
- Linode - has been fully rebranded into Akamai for running linux servers and providing a great infastructure
- Netlify very seemless, easy and great to work in, fast and easy to use for everyone, its current and very good to use these days!

## This Developer's Life: Dinosaurs

- Fortran - one of the oldest programming languages still in use besides assembly. You can tell the difference between code written in different versions of fortran as it evolves. The syntax actually makes up the version of the language. They are some of the most debugged libraries every used. Fortran is used in the nuclear industry, numerical computing and finance. Fortran provides massive performance gains and uses many pure functions to acomplish tasks. Fortran is extremely performant, and though it is well documented it was very hard to learn how to use it and create/run a compiler for it.

- There is still a lot of places where old programs and languages exist. They are very performant and different. Fortran is 'not made for modern developers' made for numerical translations and formulas, the old languages have their own specialists and purposes that we can't really get rid of, CS is a different world and modern programers and languages are always being created and updated, but these old languages do not have anything else at the base to develop and build upon or compile down into like Java which is a very high level and human readable language.

- Fortran is very powerful, precise, simple, and it does its job the best. However it is not made for modern web development or game development, etc. Its got a purpose like other old languages. Though its still a living language that does not mean that everyone should learn it. But knowing that these old languages are useful and the fact that they work and make a difference is a good thing. This goes for the other languages on the list quite closely as well.
