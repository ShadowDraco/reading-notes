# Express Rest API

## [Review ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

- Classes are a template for creating _objects_.

- Can a class declaration be hoisted?

  - JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. So yes it can be hoisted.

- How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?

  - A constructor is like a building team and their blueprints. The constructor contains measurements for an object to be built in the code and allows the team to create an object in code. 'this' can refer to pieces of the object being built 'help me cut "this"' and it can refer to the object itself like pointing to the entire house they are building and saying "this" is almost finished!

[Using Express Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

- Within Express, what does routing refer to?

  - Modularizing the methods that handle certain links on the page and routes on the server

- What is the difference between a route path and a route method?

  - A route path is the specific link the browser is requesting, and a route method is the type of request they are making.

- When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?

  - its appropriate to add next as a parameter for a route handler that has other routes behind it, or needs to have a callback. When your middleware has been passed next you must call it.
