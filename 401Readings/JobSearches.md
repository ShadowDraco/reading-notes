# Workshop and power hour with John!

## Reflect on learning

1. Offer and Negotiations?
   A: Do not accept Contract offers that you do not want. "We'll train you, no experience required" (Don't take it if they own you for 3 years)
   B: When you talk to a recruiter tell them the truth, you're requirements and what you want etc.
   C: KNOW YOUR VALUE
2. Targeted job search?
   A: The ATS Black Hole searches with an algorithm. So you need to find things on your own sometimes through networks or updating your resume
   B: When you're in a pile of 1000 resumes the computers kick out half the people, and the rest of the people are screened out. So ou should put yourself out there, reorganize your resume
   C: Create job alerts and update them often
   D: - when you get calls and target a job make notes. organize your information. remember the names of people. Treat the job search as a full time job and just remember those conversations.
3. Networking?
   A: Networking is the most important thing
   B: Look at things like Monster, indeed, careerBuilder, RobertHalf and use your resources!
   C: Targeting a job will take a cover letter and resume, but not always a job listing. your network can get you in, it can get you recommended, it can do a lot.

# Partner Power Hour

- Jon descriptions are written with a bunch of buzz words, if you have the skills and you can start then chances are that you are very well qualified. But if you are replacing someone on a team or filling a new role they will want a certain level of experience, though chances are you may be qualified enough to be trained into the team.
- When you are doing a mass job search use a general job search then you should try the easy apply button and target a specific job.
- Easy apply turns your resume into data and sends your resume that is in a good format to them as data that recruiters will bring in.
- Target job search should be 10-15 jobs with a vision and mission, product that you can work with.
- Write a cover letter than answerers the prompts they actually gave you. Use grammarly, make it professional, with good spelling and grammar
