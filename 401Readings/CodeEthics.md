As someone who is writing an assignment I think, [the code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) is so long why should I write a summary on it. As a developer who hasn't even began my job search in full force and have been keeping these questions in the back of my mind its actually nice. Knowing that a code of conduct such as this is maintained and understood. It's important to me that the people I work for and the things I do are right. It's important to me that the code I write and information I push is in line with my values and that my values are not written in stone once, but evaluated according to an accurate source of truth regularly. New projects, new promotions, new goals. These things can bring new challenges and new ideals to work with, around, or avoid. Reading [that article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) about someone's big regret in programming is something that actually slipped my mind for a little while after studying so hard in class. It was a great refresher and it only reinforces the point I make that I really need to make sure the places I'm going are right. I can't change the world from the inside unless I have some real weight. The best option is to make sure that _MY_ work is good and when it goes to the right places it will gain weight.
