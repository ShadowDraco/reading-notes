Open source IS big but not quite as scary to get started as it all seems. Open source actually has a supportive community and that is quite helpful and encouraging. I'm quite excited to start and quickly find myself getting too ambitious wanting to revisit some old projects and start something new. Though I realize I have a lot more on my plate to deal with before making PR's to big places. Contributing to open source will give me an opportunity to improve my skills, get great experience, get myself out there, and have more things on my portfolio and story. Last but definitely not least I can improve or grow software that other people use.
