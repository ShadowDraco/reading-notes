# Authorization/Authentication

## Project idea

- to have some fun and reinforce this new process and learn how to work with this larger code base I propose a shop API.

- Users can

  - can view items in the shop
  - can post requests to a requested items route. (just a description)
  - can add items to their cart ( just a list of items)

- Writers can add new items upon user request. (new item model)
- Editors can update existing items.
- Admins can
  - view users
  - update users and items
  - delete any record.
