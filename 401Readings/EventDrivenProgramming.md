# [Event Driven Programming](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

  - NodeJS has the built in event emitter to handle event driven programming

- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

  - Combining Object orienting programming with Event driven Programming gives us a flexible and modularized code that utilizes the DRY and Single-responsibility principles to make readable code that is able to communicate in extensive ways.

- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

  - Event driven programming provides the ability to do _things_ when an _something_ happens, in real time, rather than relying on waiting for data to be sent over the slow internet. Event driven programming lets the server decide when and where to update data and do its own stuff whenever it wants like a web browser does.

## Reflections and Goals

- I can't wait to learn how to use built in server events, is it like a socket system that needs an http server or is it standalone im so excited to see
