# Node Ecosystem

[Introduction to NodeJS](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)

- What is Node js for non-tech people?

  - Node is a program that allows computers to run javascript code. This is used for writing code that makes webpages interactive, and even for writing code that makes servers for the websites.

- What does "Node a JavaScript runtime" mean?

  - A javascript runtime takes the javascript engine, like Chrome V8, and gives it more functionality and control so that it is not self-contained but can be interacted with and used via new features/APIS to create programs with javascript. These programs are _running_ in time with the real world can be used in various ways

  - a runtime is a program at a _lower level_ which gives functionality and instructions to your code. The runtime of a video game takes controller input into a script which processes it and gives the game engine (runtime) data.
    Javascript is the game that is running and doing its own stuff, the game engine (NodeJS) is like the part of the game that calculates things in the background and shares data with other players on the server. When someone moves their control stick the game engine (node js) deals with certain built in tasks that the person coding the game doesn't need to worry about, like physics simulations and server stuff.

- What is Node used for?

  - NodeJS is used for running and using programs installed using npm and more. It creates an environment for writing, shipping, and installing javascript programs and frameworks using and providing various tools.

- What am I looking forward to?

  - gosh everything haha!

- My goals:
  - We're really jumping into all of this amazing practical knowledge fast and im excited to learn more about the tools I have at my disposal for creating servers and production environments and especially writing tests

## Things I want to know more about

  - I guess just if my analogies are correct and thinking about runtimes
