## Reflection

1.  What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing theÂ [class README?](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-17/)

Super stoked to learn how to connect multipl AWS's together to store data, host an app, and implement CI/CD through something other than GitHub itself!
