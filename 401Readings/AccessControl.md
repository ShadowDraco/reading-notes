# Access Control (ACL)

## [5 steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- system admin
- developer
- document admin
- user admin
- employee 1
- employee 2
- user

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- Figure out which systems need AC
- Figure out what kind of roles you need
- Assign people to roles
- Never change a role's definition for special cases, create new ones or change the person's role
- Review people's roles every once in awhile and decide to keep or modify roles / people

## [wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- Authorization is the process of granting access to someone who is who they say they are.

Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- Role assignment, Role Authorization, and Permission Authorization

Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- Role based access control is a way to organize who does what with levels of access to different parts of a system. Someone with a basic key card can't get behind the front desk, and someone with a front desk keycard can't get into the main office. And only the person who owns the bank has the key to the vault. Role. Based. Access. Control. is the way of assigning and providing permissions to those roles.

- Authenticate

Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

- Providing security and an elevation hierarchy to the system and those accessing/controlling/requesting from it.

### Reflection

- it looks like tommorow will be a jump into a bigger scheme of things requireing communication between front and back ends, ready to look at that!
