1.  Look over the above content.
    1.  Teach us two things about Next.js.

    Next JS is a leading React Framework with advanced routing, client and server side rendering, data-fetching, and more. You can add components without adding extra client code.

    2.  Teach us two things about Gatsby.js.

    Gatsby provides a blazing fast React Framework, open source and able to integrate with SSR, DSG, and cloud functions. Gatsby provides a Data Layer to improve the API integration experience. Gatsby also has gatsby cloud for deploying in realtime. Gatsby makes web creation very streamlined and provides a way to keep many of your technologies in one place.
